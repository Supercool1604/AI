## Projects in Artificial Intelligence
### 1. Implementations of BFS, UCS and A* search in a 3-D Cave like maze system with 4M+ nodes.
### 2. Implementation of Alpha-Beta pruning in order to solve a 5*5 Go Game. 
####   Went only until depth 4 for this implementation as it takes more time otherwise.
